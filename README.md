# Interpreter
### The language for everybody, yet nobody
The idea behind this language is include the most common languages from west-europe (and for some random reason I have added the turkish language).
This way everybody understands a part of the code, yet (probably) not everything. In my opinion it is a fun way to get involved with other languages!
